IS 362 â€“ Project 1
Assignment

The following is an analysis of the flight delays among Alaska airlines and AW West airlines for travel to Los Angelos, Pheonix, San Diego, San Francisco and Seattle.

#Read information from the csv file into pandas
airline_data=pd.read_csv("/Users/ccajas/Desktop/IS362 Date Acquisition/IS362 Project 1.csv")
#Analysis of the first 5 rows to check the validity of the data.

#I calculated the percent of Alaska Airlines flights that were delayed for each of the 5 destinations

# The results of the calculation are set to a new column called "Alaska_Percent_Delay"

# I can visually compare the delays of the two airlines at each destination
# It is clear that AM West airline has a greater percent of flights delayed at every destination.

Conclusion
Since the number of flights travelled among both airlines was not the same it was helpful to analyze the data based on the percentage of flights that were delayed among both airlines. The results show that AMWest had the greates percentage of delays among the five cities samples for the data set. Since a greter percentage of AWWest flights are delayed it is a reasonable to assume that Alaska airlines would be the more reliable for passengers flying to Los Angelos, Pheonix, San Diego, Sanfrancisco and Seattle.
