Documentation of set comprehension :

Comprehensions in Python provide us with a short and compact way to create new sequences (in case of set it's set comprehension)
# set comprehension
# for creating new set

Set = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 


Set_comp = {var for var in Set if var % 2 == 0} 

print("New Set using set comprehensions:",Set_comp) 



Documentation of Zip Function :

The zip() function returns a zip object contains a paired iterator, which is an iterator of tuples.In this pair, it basically pairs the first element from two tuples and so on.
ZIP:
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
zipped = list(zip(list1, list2))
print(zipped)
